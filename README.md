trigraphConversion
==================

This is simple python script to convert symbols to trigraph symbols.

Usage:
  Simply provide the file name to convert and the filename to write to in the relative locations in the main method. You can change it to take command line arguments with argv, but I am lazy and was testing with sublime.
